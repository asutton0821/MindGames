A java program based on trivia questions and facts. 

Pulls facts from various CSV files and stores them into objects. The program then uses this to generate multiple choice questions and allow the user to answer them. The user is able to "skip" some questions with penalty. There is a time limit, and the time increases as you answer questions. For points and time information, see the source code.
